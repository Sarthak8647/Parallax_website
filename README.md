# Parallax_website

The Parallax Website project showcases a visually engaging website that uses the parallax scrolling effect to create depth and dynamic movement as users scroll. Built with HTML and CSS. 

Key features:

Parallax Scrolling Effect: A smooth, layered effect where background elements move at a different speed than the foreground content, adding a sense of depth.

Responsive Design: Ensures the website looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

Smooth Transitions: Features fluid animations and transitions to enhance the user experience.

Modern Layout: Clean and visually appealing design with attention to typography and spacing.

This project demonstrates how to create an interactive and eye-catching website using basic front-end development skills.
